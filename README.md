1. Objective   
The objective of this mini-project is the creation of three supervised classification models, applying the principles of machine learning on a data set.   
The creation of a classification model is a process involving a set of steps, namely: data understanding, data preparation, creation and validation of models and finally the use of the model.   
By carrying out this mini-project, you will thus put into practice all the theoretical principles of this process using the Python language and its ecosystem (set of packages) dedicated to data science and machine learning.   
   
   
2. Data Set   
The Data Set that you will be using during this mini-project is named “US Adult Income”. This is a body of information about 48,842 US citizens collected as part of a 1994 US population census.
The goal is to create a supervised classification model that can predict whether an American adult's annual income exceeds $ 50,000 or not.   
The data set is divided into two parts: training set (train.csv) and test set (test.csv).   
   
   
3. Technical specifications   
The mini-project was carried out with the following techniques:   
Programming language: Python   
Development environment: Jupyter Notebooks   
Scientific computing packages and data manipulation: numpy, scipy, pandas   
Data visualization package: matplotlib and / or seaborn   
Machine learning package: scikit-learn   
   
   
4. Functional specifications   
In this mini-project we will cover all of the steps in the process of extracting knowledge from data.   
So, here are all the requirements that you must meet by carrying out this miniproject:   
-Data understanding   
-Data cleaning   
-Data transformation   
-Creation and optimization of models   
-Model test
